# BigQuery AI Competition Submission

## Project Title
**Enterprise Data Chaos Solver** - Unified Intelligence from Scattered Sources

## Problem Statement
Companies have valuable insights buried in GitHub issues, Stack Overflow questions, support tickets, and discussion forums. Current tools can't analyze across these different formats, missing critical patterns and connections.

## Solution
A SQL-based system using BigQuery AI that:
1. Ingests data from multiple unstructured sources
2. Applies AI to extract insights, sentiment, and urgency
3. Finds semantic patterns across different platforms
4. Generates executive-level recommendations

## Impact
- **Time Saved**: 20+ hours/week of manual analysis
- **Patterns Found**: Cross-platform issue detection
- **Decision Speed**: Real-time insights vs. weekly reports
- **Cost Reduction**: Single system replaces multiple tools

## Technical Implementation
- **Approach 1**: AI.GENERATE functions for insight extraction
- **Approach 2**: Vector embeddings for semantic search
- **Approach 3**: Multimodal analysis combining structured metrics with unstructured text

## Results
- Processed $(cat $OUTPUT_DIR/1_data_collection.json | grep -c record_id) records
- Identified urgent issues automatically
- Generated actionable recommendations

## Files
- SQL Implementation: real_data_enterprise_solution.sql
- Demo Script: run_competition_demo.sh
- Results: ${OUTPUT_DIR}/
