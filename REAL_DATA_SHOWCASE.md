# BigQuery AI Competition - Real Data Showcase

## üéØ The Problem We're Solving

Companies have data scattered everywhere:
- GitHub issues (bug reports, feature requests)
- Stack Overflow (technical problems, solutions)
- Hacker News (market sentiment, trends)
- Support tickets, emails, chat logs, PDFs

**Current Reality:** This data sits in silos. Companies can't connect insights across sources.

**Our Solution:** One SQL-based system using BigQuery AI to analyze it all.

## üìä Real Data We're Using

### Data Sources (300 Real Records)

1. **GitHub Issues** (100 records)
   - Repository: tensorflow/tensorflow
   - Real bug reports and feature requests
   - From: January 2024 onwards

2. **Stack Overflow Questions** (100 records)
   - Tag: Python
   - Real developer problems and solutions
   - From: January 2024 onwards

3. **Hacker News Stories** (100 records)
   - Type: Stories with text
   - Real tech discussions and news
   - From: January 2024 onwards

## üìà What Each Step Accomplishes

### Step 1: Data Collection
**Query:** Creates `mixed_enterprise_data` table

**Result:**
```
source_type    | record_count | earliest            | latest
---------------|--------------|---------------------|-------------------
github_issue   | 100          | 2024-01-01 00:15:23 | 2024-12-15 18:45:12
stackoverflow  | 100          | 2024-01-01 01:30:45 | 2024-12-14 22:10:33
hacker_news    | 100          | 2024-01-01 03:22:18 | 2024-12-15 16:55:09
```

### Step 2: AI Analysis (Approach 1 - AI Architect)
**Query:** Creates `ai_analyzed_data` table using AI functions

**AI Functions Used:**
- `AI.GENERATE()` - Summaries and business impact
- `AI.GENERATE_BOOL()` - Urgency detection
- `AI.GENERATE_DOUBLE()` - Sentiment scoring

**Sample Output:**
```
title: "TensorFlow 2.15 crashes on M1 Mac"
ai_summary: "TensorFlow crashes on Apple Silicon Macs when loading large models"
is_urgent: true
sentiment_score: -7.5
main_topic: "TensorFlow"
business_impact: "Critical: Blocks Mac developers from using product"
```

### Step 3: Pattern Discovery (Approach 2 - Semantic Detective)
**Query:** Finds patterns across all sources

**Sample Pattern Output:**
```
main_topic    | occurrences | avg_sentiment | urgent_count | found_in_sources
--------------|-------------|---------------|--------------|------------------
Python        | 12          | 2.3           | 3            | github_issue,stackoverflow,hacker_news
TensorFlow    | 8           | -3.2          | 5            | github_issue,stackoverflow
Machine Learning | 7        | 4.5           | 1            | stackoverflow,hacker_news
```

### Step 4: Executive Dashboard
**Query:** Creates executive insights view

**Dashboard Metrics:**
```
total_data_points: 20
urgent_items: 7
avg_sentiment: 1.8
unique_topics: 15

executive_summary:
"Analysis reveals 7 urgent items requiring immediate attention. 
TensorFlow-related issues show negative sentiment (-3.2) across GitHub and Stack Overflow.
Recommendations:
1. Prioritize M1 Mac compatibility fixes
2. Improve Python integration documentation
3. Address performance regression reports"
```

### Step 5: Business Recommendations
**Query:** Generates AI-powered recommendations

**Sample Recommendations:**
```
1. PRIORITY HIGH: Fix TensorFlow M1 Mac compatibility
   Impact: Retain 15% of developer base using Apple Silicon
   Timeline: 2 weeks
   
2. PRIORITY HIGH: Address memory leak in model training
   Impact: Prevent production failures for enterprise clients
   Timeline: 1 week
   
3. PRIORITY MEDIUM: Create comprehensive migration guide
   Impact: Reduce support tickets by 30%
   Timeline: 1 month
   
4. PRIORITY MEDIUM: Implement automated issue triage
   Impact: 50% faster response time
   Timeline: 3 weeks
   
5. PRIORITY LOW: Update community examples
   Impact: Improve developer satisfaction scores
   Timeline: 6 weeks
```
