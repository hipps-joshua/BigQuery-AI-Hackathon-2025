### 3. 💻 **Deploy to Actual BigQuery** - ESSENTIAL

#### Step-by-Step BigQuery Setup:

##### A. Create Google Cloud Account
```bash
# 1. Go to https://console.cloud.google.com
# 2. Create new project or select existing
# 3. Enable billing (required for BigQuery)
# 4. Note your PROJECT_ID
```

##### B. Install Google Cloud SDK
```bash
# macOS (you're on Mac)
brew install google-cloud-sdk

# Or download from https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install

# Authenticate
gcloud auth login
gcloud config set project YOUR_PROJECT_ID
```

##### C. Run Setup Script
```bash
cd /Users/jhipps/Documents/Big\ Query/BigQuery_Approach1_AI_Architect/scripts
chmod +x setup_bigquery.sh

# Set project ID
export PROJECT_ID="your-actual-project-id"

# Run setup
./setup_bigquery.sh
```

##### D. Fix Common Issues

**Issue: "API not enabled"**
```bash
gcloud services enable bigquery.googleapis.com
gcloud services enable aiplatform.googleapis.com
gcloud services enable bigqueryconnection.googleapis.com
```

**Issue: "Model endpoint not found"**
```sql
-- Use these exact model endpoints
CREATE OR REPLACE MODEL `PROJECT.DATASET.text_generation_model`
REMOTE WITH CONNECTION `PROJECT.us-central1.gemini_connection`
OPTIONS(endpoint = 'gemini-1.5-pro');

CREATE OR REPLACE MODEL `PROJECT.DATASET.embedding_model`
REMOTE WITH CONNECTION `PROJECT.us-central1.gemini_connection`
OPTIONS(endpoint = 'text-embedding-004');
```

**Issue: "Permission denied"**
```bash
# Grant yourself BigQuery Admin
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding PROJECT_ID \
  --member="user:YOUR_EMAIL@gmail.com" \
  --role="roles/bigquery.admin"

# Grant Vertex AI User
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding PROJECT_ID \
  --member="user:YOUR_EMAIL@gmail.com" \
  --role="roles/aiplatform.user"
```

##### E. Test AI Functions
```sql
-- Test each AI function
SELECT AI.GENERATE_TEXT(
  MODEL `PROJECT.DATASET.text_generation_model`,
  PROMPT => 'Generate a product description for blue shoes',
  STRUCT(0.8 AS temperature)
) AS test_generation;

SELECT AI.GENERATE_BOOL(
  MODEL `PROJECT.DATASET.text_generation_model`,
  PROMPT => 'Is $99 expensive for shoes?',
  STRUCT(0.1 AS temperature)
) AS test_bool;

SELECT AI.GENERATE_INT(
  MODEL `PROJECT.DATASET.text_generation_model`,
  PROMPT => 'Extract size from: Size 10 shoes',
  STRUCT(0.1 AS temperature)
) AS test_int;
```
