# CatalogAI: Three BigQuery AI Approaches That Tackle E‑commerce’s $10B Catalog Problem

## Problem Statement
E‑commerce catalogs are messy: 30–40% of products lack complete/consistent data, duplicates inflate inventory costs, and images rarely match listed specs. The result is lower discovery and conversion, high QC overhead, and compliance risk.

## Impact Statement
- Time savings: 80–95% on enrichment, QC, and triage
- Cost reduction: $500K–$2M annually (duplicate inventory, QC labor, compliance risk)
- Conversion lift: +15–30% via better content and discovery
- Scale: Millions of products and images processed directly in BigQuery

## Approach 1 – The AI Architect (Template‑Driven Enrichment & Forecasting)
- What: 256 pre‑validated SQL templates + BigQuery AI functions for enrichment, validation, and forecasting
- Key features:
  - Product descriptions, SEO, attribute extraction (AI.GENERATE_*)
  - Data validation (AI.GENERATE_BOOL/INT/DOUBLE)
  - Demand forecasting (ML.FORECAST)
- Why it matters: Zero‑hallucination via data grounding and reusable templates. Enterprise‑ready with monitoring and cost controls.

## Approach 2 – The Semantic Detective (Vector Search + AI Validation)
- What: Multi‑aspect embeddings (title/attributes/full) with semantic search, duplicate detection, and smart substitutes
- Key features:
  - ML.GENERATE_EMBEDDING + VECTOR_SEARCH (with vector index)
  - AI validation/explanations for duplicates and recommendations
- Why it matters: Finds hidden duplicates and relevant substitutes, reducing inventory waste and improving search quality.

## Approach 3 – The Multimodal Pioneer (Images + Structured Data)
- What: Object Tables + vision analysis for quality control, compliance checks, and visual search
- Key features:
  - ML.ANALYZE_IMAGE for native vision signals
  - Multimodal embeddings + visual search
- Why it matters: Prevents costly returns and fines; improves discovery beyond text.

## Architecture (High‑Level)
Data → BigQuery (tables + Object Tables) → AI (text/vision/embeddings) → Orchestration (templates, procedures) → Dashboards & ROI

## How We Used BigQuery AI
- Text: AI.GENERATE / ML.GENERATE_TEXT for descriptions, titles, summaries
- Structured: AI.GENERATE_TABLE / INT / DOUBLE / BOOL
- Embeddings: ML.GENERATE_EMBEDDING + VECTOR_SEARCH with vector index
- Forecast: ML.FORECAST for SKU demand
- Multimodal: Object Tables + ML.ANALYZE_IMAGE for image QC and compliance

## Demo Assets
- Notebooks: One per approach (public)
- Repositories: Setup scripts, SQL, and docs (public)
- Video: 5–7 minute live demo showing queries + ROI dashboard

## Results & ROI
- Enrichment: 3 min → seconds per product; $25K+/month time savings
- Dedupe: $300K+ inventory freed; +40% search relevance
- Multimodal QC: −25% returns; $2M+ combined savings across risk areas
